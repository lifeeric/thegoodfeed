# The Good Feed
The Good Feed is a web application that is intended to be a resource to help those struggling with mental health, more specifically those who are Muslim. The app provides general mental health and Islamic resources in the form of a feed.

## Objective
The Good Feed was created as a project for [Ummahacks](https://www.ummahacks.com/). 

## Inspiration
The Good Feed started as an idea to create a more positive feed in the age of social media and to eliminate the typical negative feelings that arise from using social media, such as comparison, being influenced, inadequacy, FOMO, suppressing your feelings, information overload, and feeling lost spiritually. We then expanded our original app idea to include mental health and islamic resources. We want users to leave this app feeling much better about themselves along with more hope and connection to their faith compared to the usage of other social media platforms.

## Users
Our user base consists of Muslims who speak English.

## What It Does
The Good Feed is a web app that asks the user how they’re feeling that day in the form of a question on the home page. Once the user chooses an emotion emoji out of the six available options, they are taken to a new page that displays a grid of images that include quotes, books, podcasts, hadiths, ayahs (verses) from the Quran, and art pertaining to the emotion selected. An emotion navigation bar is also available on each emotion page that allows users to navigate to all of the others emotion pages within the app.

## Built With

## Challenges
- 2/4 members of our team had never used Git and GitHub before 
- 3/4 members of our team had never used React
- We lived in different timezones: 2/4 members of our team is in EST timezone and 2/4 members of our team is in PST timezone
- 2/4 members of our team had jobs and 1/4 members of our team was taking summer classes

## Accomplishments
- Despite our levels of experience, we were all able to contribute to this project while teaching each other throughout the process.

## Things We Learned
- We all learned and gained experience executing the general git workflow.
- We all learned how to successfully deal with merge conflicts.
- We all were able to learn and create a basic project using React.

## Next Steps and Goals
We plan on adding more features in the future, such as the following:
1. Use a database, rather than Imgur, to store images, which will allow the creation of a more dynamic feed.
2. Rather than loading a new page for every emotion, have one page that loads the appropriate emotion grid without reloading the whole page.
3. Add a “Resources” tab to include mental health organizations that cater to the general public and Muslims in the West after they’ve been vetted.
